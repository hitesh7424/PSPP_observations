#Program to work with pandas Dataframes
import pandas as pd
data=={"Name":["Ram","Subash","Raghul","Arun","Deepak"],"Age":[24,25,24,
26,25],"CGPA":[9.5,9.3,9.0,8.5,8.8]}
t=pd.DataFrame(data)
t.index+=1
print(t)
Name Age CGPA
1 Ram 24 9.5
2 Subash 25 9.3
3 Raghul 24 9.0
4 Arun 26 8.5
5 Deepak 25 8.8
Result

3. Create an array of values with 2 rows and 3 columns.
4. Print the values and the dimension of the array.
5. Reshape the dimension of the array using reshape.
6. Print the values and dimension
7. Stop
Ex. No. 8(b)
